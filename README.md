* REDCap Stanford Survey Authentication *

This external module enables us to force user authentication for surveys designed for institutional users
It hasn't been updated to reflect the latest in EM designs (logging, readme, etc...)

It also has not been updated to be more generic and support other shibboleth institutions.  It is on the todo list, sorry :-)

Please email me at andy123 at stanford . edu if you're interested in this and I can try to prioritize...
